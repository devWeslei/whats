## About this Project

-Firebase Storage.   


## Functionalities   
-registered user authentication.   
-simultaneous chat with users.   
-edit name and profile picture.   

## Difficulties
-this project was made based on the course [Desenvolvimento Android e IOS com Flutter](https://www.udemy.com/course/desenvolvimento-android-e-ios-com-flutter/), from
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=0EOJOrTo2D4&ranSiteID=0EOJOrTo2D4-jEdslSFjh_Izd2eciLplfw&LSNPUBID=0EOJOrTo2D4&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads), but due to the frequent updates of Flutter many functionalities and syntax have changed, so I fixed it by searching one by one.   
This challenge sure made me improve my skills! lol    
In the end it was pretty cool!
## Made in
-Flutter 2.10.4 ‚Ä¢ channel stable.   
-Dart SDK version: 2.16.2 (stable).
